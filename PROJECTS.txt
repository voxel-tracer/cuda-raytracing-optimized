ALL PROJECTS

 RENDER STAIRCASE SCENE
 ----------------------
- load staircase scene, its made up of multiple obj models that rely on simple materials along with albdeo textures
- can provide really good visual result and the large number of triangles will be a good motivation to work on optimazing the kernels
- doesn't require any advanced material or editor features
- there are many more scenes are available here, including the San Miguel scene:

 RENDER SAN MIGUEL SCENE
 -----------------------
- has a lot of textures and may require sorting the rays
- can be a good fit for an Opengl tool that allows editing the materials and render settings
  to make it realistic

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 STATUES RENDERING
 -----------------
- focus on BRDF materials (no need for transmission, subsurface scattering)
- render high poly models from cgtrader (non textured, clay like)
 . I may subdivide the triangles in an externel tool to not have to interpolate the normals too much
- works better with a basic Opengl editor that allows moving camera/light around
  and configuring camera/light and model material (single material for whole model)
 . preview mode similar to KnightCrawler PathTracer could work really well here
- I may quickly implement Disney BRDF, by copying the code from somewhere else, e.g.:
	https://github.com/knightcrawler25/Optix-PathTracer/blob/master/src/optixPathTracer/disney.cu

 ANNO WII PICO8
 --------------
- building toolbar
 . draw a few colored sprites at the top line of the map
 . when mouse pressed, check if its on the toolbar
   if it is select current sprite using the mouse position
   if its not, draw the current sprite on the map
- buildings have different properties (width, height, sprite)
 . when you select the building its properties are saved in a global variable
 . when you draw it those properties are used to draw the right number of cells with the correct sprite
 . for now the cursor doesn't change
- build cursor reflects the size of the building
 . draw a rectangle instead of using map sprites
 . but do not care about the color of the sprite

- draw road lines
