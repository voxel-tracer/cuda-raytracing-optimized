POLYGON RENDERER (PHASE I)
- one line summary
  apply all the optimization techniques I learned so far to produce high quality renders really quickly
  (this is the same work I've been doing for the past year but with great looking renders)
- required features
 . support large poly models, think sculptures (CGTrader)
 . support a few interesting materials that produce great renders
   (tinted glass, subsurface scattering, plastic)
 .  basic lighting and background setup that produces great renders
   (transparent bg with invisible plane that catches shadows and reflections)
 . apply all the optimizations I learned so far along with any other optimization that may improve the
   performance of the renderer (SAH BVH building, russian roulette, ...)

PBR MATERIAL EDITOR (PHASE II)
- one line summary
  allow user to configure PBR materials and replace existing sculpture materials with those
  producing incredible renders (think CGTrader Marvel/DC Comics renders) really fast

PHASE I: POLYGON RENDERER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 REQUIREMENTS
 ------------
- support large triangle mesh .obj models
- support a few interesting materials that produce great renderers
 . tinted glass with Beer-lambert model
 . Peter Shirley's brute force subsurface scattering
 . also see this answer that goes into a lot of details about SSS: https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/5214/a-recent-approach-for-subsurface-scattering
 . existing plastic (diffuse + coat)
- basic lighting and background setup that produces great renderers

* at this point I should have great looking renderer that are too slow
 . now I can start optimizing the renderer as much as possible
 
* once the renderer is fast enough I can add support for an OpenGL viewer
 . this will showcase how quickly can my renderer produce interesting images

Ideal target is to finish PHASE I by end of Ramadan (5 weeks)

PHASE I
- extend my renderer to support polygon models
- good light setup and transparent background
- do not worry about optimization and focus on models that can fit in constant memory

OTHER DELIVERABLES IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER
- tinted glass material
- support large polygon models
- subsurface scattering (Peter Shirley Volume rendering)
- raylib mesh viewer that supports rendering directly to the viewport
 . we can start with render goes straight to disk
- advanced materials: implement Disney BRDF and add UI to configure materials
- allow setting different material per original model color
