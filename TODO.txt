FEATURES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 LOW POLYGON RENDERER (PHASE I)
 --------------------------
- one line summary
  apply all the optimization techniques I learned so far to produce high quality renders really quickly
  (this is the same work I've been doing for the past year but with great looking renders)
- required features
 . support low poly models that can fit in constant memory. I may simplify models to reduce their poly count
 . support a few interesting materials that produce great renders
   (tinted glass, subsurface scattering, coat)
 . basic lighting and background setup that produces great renders
 . apply all the optimizations I learned so far along with any other optimization that may improve the
   performance of the renderer (SAH BVH building, russian roulette, ...)
- optional features
 . transparent bg with invisible plane that allows you to change to color of the whole background while keeping
   the shadows and reflections on the floor

 HIGH QUALITY POLYGON RENDERER (PHASE II)
 ----------------------------------------
- one line summary
  enhance phase 1 renderer to support high quality models (sculptures) and optimize BVH construction/traversal
  to render the models as quickly as possible (ideally in real-time)
- required features
 
 PBR MATERIAL EDITOR (PHASE III)
 ------------------------------
- one line summary
  allow user to configure PBR materials and replace existing sculpture materials with those
  producing incredible renders (think CGTrader Marvel/DC Comics renders) really fast

 OTHER DELIVERABLES IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER
 -----------------------------------------
- support large polygon models
- subsurface scattering (Peter Shirley Volume rendering)
- raylib mesh viewer that supports rendering directly to the viewport
 . we can start with render goes straight to disk
 . this will be useful when building my own rendering/material tool
- integrate with Lighthouse 2
 . we get a model loader/viewer for free
 . we get PBRT scenes loading for free
 . we get a lots of physically-based materials for free
 . we can compare performance of my renderer vs others
 . this is useful when I just want to focus on the render core and optimize it
- advanced materials: implement Disney BRDF and add UI to configure materials
- allow setting different material per original model color

 IMPROVEMENTS IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER
 -----------------------------------
- use MeshLab to simplify complex models so they can fit in constant memory
- when importing a model, define its orientation (up vector) and make sure its loading
  in the correct orientation. Makes it easier to use a standard camera position and orient
  the environment map
- camera distance is computed automatically such that the whole model is visible in the viewport
- transparent background (useful to create interesting renders in Gimp)
 . note that ideally we want to capture the full RGB of the background/floor as an ALPHA channel but no image format
   supports this
 . alternative is to treat background/floor differently when hit by primary ray
  . use a different color defined by the user that doesn't affect the scene
- resume rendering from saved file (useful when we want to add more samples to an already expensive render)
- can we preprocess the triangles to identify the ones that don't face any other triangle from the model ?
 . we could use this to quickly identify no_hits for secondary rays
- Gimp "White Balance" improves the quality of the final renderer
 . can I implement the same strategy in my renderer ?
- all rendering params are configurables from a simple test file. Create a separate file per test scene

PHASE I.1: POLYGON RENDERER
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 REQUIREMENTS
 ------------
- support triangle mesh .obj models that fit in constant memory
- support a few interesting materials that produce great renderers
 . DONE tinted glass with Beer-lambert model
 . DONE existing plastic/coat (diffuse + glass)
- DONE basic lighting and background setup that produces great renderers

 DELIVERABLES
 ------------
- great looking renders that may be too slow to renderer

 TASKS
 -----
 - DONE render obj model
- DONE floor
- DONE light and next event estimation
- DONE Lambert-Beer absorption

 NEXT (move these to their own steps later)
 ----
- apply basic optimizations from my previous work to speedup the rendering a bit
 . we should expect very good speedup with not much effort
- add subsurface-scattering material
- add OpenGL/imGUI viewer (from my spheres renderer)
 . quickly configure the scene to get high quality renderers
- Subsurface scattering material
 . https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/5214/a-recent-approach-for-subsurface-scattering

 PERF
 ----
- tinted-glass on coat 1200x800x4096 in 1045s (17m45s)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE I.2 BASIC OPTIMIZATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- use the ray stats I collected and identify strategies to reduce total number of traced rays
- apply optimization strategies from my previous work without introducing a full BVH
- target 20x speedup => tinted on coat w 4096spp should render in < 1mn (vs +20mn now)
- do not worry about good design as we are mostly interested by the performance of the renderer
 
 DELIVERABLES
 ------------
- Fast renderer that can be extended with more expensive materials (in phase 1.3)  and larger models (in phase 2)
  Render tinted-glass on coat w 4096spp < 1mn

 TASKS
 -----
- DONE handle floor as proper infinite plane in kernel
- DONE compute bounding box for the mesh and use it to quickly discard rays
  PERF: 1045s (17m45s) > 757s (12m37s) = 25% speedup
- DONE measue how many secondary rays are from the mesh
- DONE measure how many secondary rays are nohit
- DONE if N samples of same pixel didn't hit the model then remaining samples should just intersect the floor
  in total we pruned 2.7B rays but 2.2B of those rays were bb nohit anyway so not much performance gain
- DONE build a simplified grid acceleration structure
  for N^3 grid rays will at most traverse 3N => 
  N=2 => 4x
  N=4 => 5x
  N=8 => 20x
  PERF 757s > 531s (8m51s) = 30% speedup
- investigate perf bottlenecks of grid (suspect its too much memory access)
- copy grid to constant memory
- copy triangles to global memory then texture memory
  given that we access them randomly they many not benefit from constant mem
- [optional] use russian roulette to stop tracing low intensity paths
  https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/5214/a-recent-approach-for-subsurface-scattering
  user defines number of bounces before we start applying RR = RR_start_bounce
  this can provide a 20% speedup and even more considering those bounces are most likely with high divergence
 . implement RMSE to measure quality loss for various RR_start_bounce
   https://jacco.ompf2.com/2020/04/07/speeding-up-lighthouse-2/
- NOPE [optional] preprocess the triangles and identify the ones that don't face any other triangle from the mesh
 . those triangles are guaranteed to not hit anything for their shadow and scattered rays (except floor for scattered rays)
 . depends on how many triangles have this property
 . stats show that only 16% of all secondary rays don't hit the mesh => that's the most we can hope to optimize away (not worth it)
- [extra] use meshLab to simplify more complex models and render them
