 power < 0.01:  1.485.850.614
took 1045.88 seconds.

- given that we traverse all triangles, nohit rays are the most expensive
- 76% of all primary rays are nohit
- 83% of all shadow rays are nohit
- 19% of all rays have intensity < 1%

 MESH BBOX (1045s > 757s)
 ---------

num rays:
 primary             : 3.932.160.000
 primary nohit       : 2.990.815.695 (76% of primary)
 primary bb nohit    : 1.742.724.149 (44% of primary)
 secondary           : 7.877.692.712 (200% of primary)
 secondary no hit    : 3.290.323.148 (42% of secondary)
 secondary bb nohit  : 2.788.640.561 (35% of secondary)
 secondary mesh      : 4.014.345.511 (50% of secondary)
 secondary mesh nohit:   641.836.422 (16% of secondary mesh)
 shadows             : 3.407.333.797
 shadows nohit       : 2.836.615.599 (83% of shadows)
 shadows bb nohit    : 2.349.059.778 (69% of shadows)
 power < 0.01        : 1.485.850.611
took 756.877 seconds.

 PRUNE PIXELS THAT DON'T INTERSECT MESH
 --------------------------------------
 primary             : 3,932,160,000
 primary nohit       : 2,990,823,552
 primary bb nohit    :   857,644,258
 secondary           : 7,853,742,117
 secondary no hit    : 3,298,552,837
 secondary bb nohit  : 1,470,254,530
 secondary mesh      : 3,991,612,560
 secondary mesh nohit:   633,606,733
 shadows             : 3,406,409,916
 shadows nohit       : 2,835,735,688
 shadows bb nohit    : 2,348,226,897
 pruned              : 2,700,481,076
 power < 0.1         : 1,478,241,208
 
 - 2.7B rays were pruned (only need to intersect plane)
 - primary bb nohit had 885K less rays (most likely were pruned)
 - secondary bb nohit had 1.3B less rays (most likely were pruned)
 - so in total we pruned 2.7B rays but 2.2B of those rays were bb nohit anyway
   so not a lot of saved traversal

notes:
- access to constant memory is serialized, thus the cost scales linearly with number of unique addresses read by all threads within a warp.
  constant memory is cached though, so it is possible the value is already present in the cache
  . metric `stall_constant_memory_dependency`: Percentage of stalls occurring because of immediate constant cache miss
